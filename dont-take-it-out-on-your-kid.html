  <h1>Don’t Take It Out On Your Kid</h1>
  <p>
Parenting an autistic child can be overwhelming. It can break you open in ways no one warns you about — the sleepless nights, the meltdowns (theirs and yours), the grief for a life you imagined that now looks different. That grief is real. But it’s not your child’s fault.<br><br>
Your child is not your punching bag, your stress release, or the reason you feel like you’re drowning. They’re just a kid — trying to navigate a world that doesn’t work for them, with a brain that doesn’t respond the way others expect. They are not doing this to you. They are doing the best they can.<br><br>
<b>If you’re angry, frustrated, or resentful — that doesn’t make you a bad parent.</b> It makes you human. But acting from that space can cause deep harm. It teaches your child that their needs are a burden. It tells them they are the problem.<br><br>
Instead:
<ul>
<li>Take breaks when you can</li>
<li>Ask for help (even if it’s just a vent text)</li>
<li>Breathe before you speak</li>
<li>Learn your own triggers</li>
<li>Say sorry when you screw up — and mean it</li>
</ul>
Your child is watching you for how to handle frustration. You get to model that. You get to show them how love stays, even when it’s tired.
