  <h1>Calming the Gut, Clearing the Brain: A Guide to Detox and Digestive Supplements for Autism Support</h1>

  <p>For many children on the autism spectrum, underlying inflammation, gut imbalance, or even toxic buildup can make everyday sensory input feel overwhelming. This leads to tantrums, stimming, aggression, foggy cognition, and emotional overload.</p>

  <p>While there's no "cure" for autism, there are tools that can help the body function better — and when the body feels better, so does the brain.</p>

  <p>Below is a parent-friendly guide to powerful natural supplements that may ease discomfort, support detoxification, and promote balance.</p>

  <!-- Entries for each product (omitted for brevity in this code block) -->
  <p><em>⚠️ Always consult with your child's pediatrician, integrative physician, or functional medicine provider before introducing any new supplement. Detox protocols, especially involving cilantro and chlorella, should be approached gradually and with guidance.</em></p>
