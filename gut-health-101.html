  <h1>Gut Health 101</h1>
  <p>
You’ve probably heard people talk about the gut-brain connection, especially in the autism space. It’s not a fad — it’s real.<br><br>
<b>The gut is like a second brain.</b> When it’s inflamed or unbalanced, it can affect mood, behavior, sleep, and even speech.<br><br>
Many autistic kids deal with gut issues:
<ul>
<li>Constipation or diarrhea</li>
<li>Reflux</li>
<li>Food intolerances</li>
<li>Bloating or pain</li>
</ul>
And that discomfort often shows up as aggression, meltdowns, or regression.<br><br>
<b>Where to Start:</b>
<ol>
<li>Cut ultra-processed foods — especially food dyes and added sugars</li>
<li>Add probiotics and prebiotic fiber — either with food or gentle supplements</li>
<li>Try gluten-free/dairy-free for 30 days — and track changes</li>
<li>Consider digestive enzymes if they struggle with absorption</li>
<li>Hydrate — a lot of gut issues are made worse by low water intake</li>
</ol>
Always work with a professional who understands the gut-brain axis — not just any pediatrician.<br><br>
Your child deserves to feel good in their body. Healing starts there.
